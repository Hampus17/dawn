# Motion QA
- [ ] With reduced motion ON, no animations run; reveal content appears immediately
- [ ] Focus ring visible for all interactive elements
- [ ] Hover/active states are subtle (opacity/1px press), no layout shift
- [ ] Scroll reveal uses .reveal → .reveal-in and never blocks rendering
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90 on mobile after enabling motion
